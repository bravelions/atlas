How to run:

1. Make sure you have [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) installed globally.

2. Make sure you have [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) installed globally.

3. This project has been setup as a monorepo. From the root `/` level of the application, run `yarn start`. This will run both the `app` and the `server` in parallel.

How to install packages:

Please make sure that when you install a new package you always use `yarn`, and that you are inside the directory of the workspace you want to add a package to e.g. `cd packages/app` and then `yarn add { package_name }`.
